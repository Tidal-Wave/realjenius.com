<p>I have long time been a proponent of WordPress for a quick and painless blogging platform. For years I toiled to create 
    a favorable personal blogging platform; re-inventing it time and again in some variant of Java technologies, and constantly being
    fed up. Despite being a good learning experience, my custom blog was always a thorough pain in my ass to maintain.
    That's what made Drupal, and later WordPress, so appealing. I was able to focus on what I wanted to do, which was deliver
    content, without having to futz with my rushed and unfinished web forms. I knew that my site software was going to be
    maintained and regularly audited by community reports with respect to security, etc. Unfortunately, despite the flexibility
    and plugin architecture, WordPress carries a certain degree of cruft with it:</p>
<ul>
    <li>PHP is surprisingly hard to host scalably and efficiently.</li>
    <li>WordPress needs a rack of plugins installed to be even remotely performant - most of it gross caching schemes.</li>
    <li>I rather despise maintaining relational database installations.</li>
</ul>
<p>
I've never been a fan of PHP in any shape or form, so I think it says a lot about how burnt out I had become on trying to 
    build a one-man CMS, that I was using WP, and singing its praises.</p>
<p>A post over at <a href="http://nesbot.com">Nesbot.com</a> inspired me to revisit my embargo on personal blog coding,
    as Brian Nesbitt <a href="http://nesbot.com/2011/11/22/now-running-on-play-2-beta">detailed how he migrated his blog 
    with Play 2.0</a>. What struck me in particular was, not so much that he was using <a href="http://www.playframework.org">Play!</a>, 
    nor that he was now using the shiny 2.0 beta, but that he had built his site without any complex data-store on the back-end.</p>
<p>Suddenly: lightbulb! This triggered me to explore the ideas he so graciously shared with his public site code on github:
    <a href="https://github.com/briannesbitt/nesbot.com">https://github.com/briannesbitt/nesbot.com</a>. Of particular note:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>His blog entries are simply Play! UI templates.</li>
    <li>The entire blog-entry history is loaded in memory at startup, and cross-indexed for the various navigation.</li>
    <li>The comment system is provided by <a href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a>.</li>
    <li>Blog entries are committed to GitHub, and ostensibly pulled to his server where he then simply restarts the 
    server to load the new article.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    I didn't spend much time actually digesting his code, but I appreciate that he posted his approach online, as it
    immediately got my gears turning. While I'm not quite ready to share the source of my site (more on this in a moment),
    I will share some details on the approach I've taken:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Each of my blog posts is a template file, and has a "meta" comment on the top. This defines things like the
        title, a short summary, the publish date, tags (comma-separated), the category (journal or article),
        and optionally some additional compatibility bits, like a legacy id (see below). The comment is YAML formatted
        so I have some leniency as I'm authoring, and good error reporting if I get the formatting wrong.</li>
    <li>The file name represents the blog "slug".</li>
    <li>On startup, I spin through the entire post directory recursively, reading the header comments one-by-one, and
        tossing them into a series of in-memory indexes for traversal. The collections are sorted in date descending order,
        as that's the most generally useful ordering for the site.</li>
    <li>The re-load process can also be triggered by an administrative call through the HTTP interface. The reload is completely
    free of locks via some judicious use of atomic references.</li>
    <li>I'm also using <a href="http://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a> for my comment system, like Brian. Importing from my
        existing wordpress site was, for the most part painless. I simply installed the Disqus plugin into my WP install,
        and did an export. The hardest part was supporting legacy identifiers. Turns out the IDs that
        it uses are: <code>[wpid] http://[site-address]?p=[wpid]</code> - this is where the legacy ID entry comes in to play above.</li>
    <li>I have a private git repo on my server, and every time I write an article, I simply push to the git repo. The server then
    pulls from the git repo, and I run the administrative reload.</li>
    <li>I'm using <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter</a> for code highlighting. The highlighters 
    that are declared in the post are loaded in "on-demand", so the included JS is kept to a minimum.</li>
    <li>I have a few custom Play! tags to make writing blogs easier - they do things like reverse routes to other blog posts into anchor tags,
        create captioned image markup, and dynamically generate series blocks (as seen in my <a href="/tags/distilling-jruby">Distilling JRuby</a> series).</li>
    <li>I'm using a Play profile ID on my server, and %prod. prefixes to support dev and prod properties concurrently
    in the same file.</li>
    <li>I'm using a variant of <a href="http://www.playframework.org/community/snippets/17">This Ubuntu up-start script</a> to bootstrap
    my Play! Framework runtime.</li>
    <li>Thanks to the expressiveness of the the Play routes system, I was able to effectively model my URLs without any
    change in pathing to match the existing WordPress site. There are some exceptions, but they are only places where I
    felt a change was for the best.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have immediately noticed a complete lack of latency on page loads, which I find quite refreshing. Occasionally one of the 
Javascript chunks blocks the page-load a bit (whether it be Google Analytics, Disqus, the syntax highlighter, or the Twitter widget, I can't say). I am keeping 
my eye out for this, and hopefully will figure it out with Firebug, and I can squash it. Overall, this has been a minimalist's dream as compared to something
chunky like WP.</p>
<p>Before I globally share the blog code, I really wanted to get a few things tidied up (call me vain):</p>
<ul>
    <li>Right now the administrative reload is a bit of a shim. I'd really like this to be an automated "on-git-update" event, 
    so my involvement is simply a matter of avoiding malformed posting, and pushing the content.</li>
    <li>My error handling is pretty weak-sauce right now - I was slapping this together pretty quickly; the majority of my 
    time was in converting my blog entries (which I did by hand, like an idiot).</li>
    <li>Right now I'm using Play 1.2.4 - I want to move to 2.0, but unlike Brian, I plan to wait until it's final before 
    converting.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once I get through those hurdles, I'll throw out a follow-up, and hopefully some public mirrors so folks can get some
value (however small) out of my derivative journey. If you have any questions in the mean-time, <a href="/contact">send me a note</a>.</p>
