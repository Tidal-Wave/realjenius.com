<p>There is a new "<a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/between_two_ferns">Between Two Ferns</a>" with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0302108/">Zach Galifianakis</a> over at
<a href="http://funnyordie.com">FunnyOrDie.com</a> - this time with <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000234/">Charlize Theron</a>. With most of the previous 'Two Fern' 
    interview series, Zach does a remarkable job of combining an awkward, crass, and clueless approach to (supposedly) piss off his interviewee, and typically in short order. Prior interviewees include: Michael Cera, Jimmy Kimmel, Jon Hamm, Bradley Cooper, and Natalie Portman.</p>

<p>In this interview, the tables seem a bit turned; his approach has a different effect.</p>

<p>Never has an advertisement for <a href="http://www.shift.needforspeed.com/us">Need for Speed: Shift</a> been so convincing.</p>

<p>While this one certainly has some good parts, my personal favorite is still the <a href="http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/5ef1adb57b/between-two-ferns-with-zach-galifianakis?rel=user&amp;rel_pos=2">Natalie Portman</a> interview.</p>
