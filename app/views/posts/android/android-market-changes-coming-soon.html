<p>It was inevitable (frankly I'm surprised they didn't squeeze it in to 1.5) - The Android market is being overhauled<a title="Android Market Updates" href="http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2009/09/some-news-from-android-market.html"> to be a lot shinier</a>. I suppose the main goal, however, is to improve the functionality for both consumers and content publishers.</p>
<blockquote>I'm pleased to let you know about several updates to Android Market. First, we will soon introduce new features in Android Market for Android 1.6 that will improve the overall experience for users. As part of this change, developers will be able to provide screenshots, promotional icons and descriptions that will better show off applications and games.

    We have also added four new sub-categories for applications: sports, health, themes, and comics. Developers can now choose these sub-categories for both new and existing applications via the publisher website. Finally, we have added seller support for developers in Italy. Italian developers can go to the publisher website to upload applications and target any of the countries where paid applications are currently available to users.

    To take advantage of the upcoming Android Market refresh, we encourage you to visit the Android Market publisher website and upload additional marketing assets. Check out the video below for some of the highlights.</blockquote>
