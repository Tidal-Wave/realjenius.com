In a surprising move, the JetBrains team [has decided to open-source](http://blogs.jetbrains.com/idea/2009/10/intellij-idea-open-sourced/) the JavaSE portions of IntelliJ IDEA 9.0 and beyond under an Apache 2.0 license. They will begin offering two products, a community edition, and an ultimate edition:

> Starting with the upcoming version 9.0, [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/index.html?utm_source=IDEA_BLOG&amp;utm_media=Anouncement&amp;utm_campaign=IDEA9_CE) will be offered in two editions: Community Edition and Ultimate Edition. The Community Edition focuses on Java SE technologies, Groovy and Scala development. It’s free of charge and open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. The Ultimate edition with full Java EE technology stack remains our standard commercial offering. See the [feature comparison matrix](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/nextversion/editions_comparison_matrix.html?utm_source=IDEA_BLOG&amp;utm_media=Anouncement&amp;utm_campaign=IDEA9_CE) for the differences.

Very cool news! The impact in competition for other IDEs (namely [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and [NetBeans](http://www.netbeans.org)) remains to be seen, but this certainly brings another aggressive (and already well-liked competitor) to a broader market.
