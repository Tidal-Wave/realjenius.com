Hello! My name is R.J. Lorimer, and I'm a professional software developer.

I am currently the **Director of Platform Engineering** for [Electrotank, Inc.](http://www.electrotank.com), which effectively boils down to me being technically responsible for the development of all of our products. My responsibilities include:

* Lead server developer
* Primary design and product direction
* Mr. Fixit

I have recently presented at [QCon](http://qconnewyork.com/) and [GDC](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1016590/Lag-Sucks-Making-Online-Gaming) on our tech *(requires GDC Vault access)*.

Prior to Electrotank, I've worked on a variety of large projects, technically leading mid-size powerful teams.

* I have been developing in Java for over a dozen years.
* I have several years experience with Ruby, C#, Javascript, HTML, and general relational database and web technology.
* My expertise is in building high-concurrency, low-latency, fault-tolerant systems.
* I have done a significant amount of editorial work over the years.
* I do all my own stunts.

Please feel free to [Contact Me](/contact.html)!
