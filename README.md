# RealJenius.com Site Source

This is the Jekyll site source for http://realjenius.com.

Of particular note for lurkers:
* Custom category/tag index and feed generation within `_plugins`.
* A few other custom plugins for generating post urls, and expanding URLs when generating feeds.
* Stylesheets and layout are all [Twitter Bootstrap](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) based.
* Pygments cache in place to not make builds totally suck.
